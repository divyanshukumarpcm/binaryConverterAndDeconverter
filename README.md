# binary Converter And Deconverter for MATLAB
MATLAB code snippet to convert any file to Binary array of 0s and 1s and convert Binary array 0s and 1s back to the file.


The program converts ANY file to stream of 0s and 1s and then back to the
original file. Any work should be done in WORK section as mentioned in
code segment. The processed bits must satisfy the file format in which it
is being saved. If no WORK is done, this program takes a file, convert to
unsigned 8-bit data and then converts to binary(0 and 1) array, then it
takes the binary array converts to unsigned 8-bit data and save the file
in original format to obtain a COPY of the file.
